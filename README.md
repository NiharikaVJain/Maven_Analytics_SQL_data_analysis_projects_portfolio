### 🧠 Key Concepts & Skills Demonstrated

- SQL querying fundamentals: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `HAVING`
- Advanced joins: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`
- Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Conditional logic: `CASE`, `IF`, `COUNT`
- Data transformation with UNION operator
- Bridging unrelated tables using intermediate joins
- Business insight generation from raw relational data
